As the days get colder and Minski’s daylight savings rants reach an all-time high,
the team has been busy getting in the last cross country and road races of the season. 
This past October the team were shipping up to Boston for the 2018 instalment of the B.A.A. 
Mayor’s Cup held in scenic Franklin Park. After a cold and windy race, Everett Hackett posted 
an impressive 6th place finish in 24:21. Phil Mitchell also ran a very strong race finishing in 27:09 
followed by myself in 28:29. After a cool-down consisting of a few miles and a few more beers at the pub down the street, 
the squad left Beantown with a renewed drive.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
On the blacktop, Kevin Rivera made his marathon debut here at home in Hartford with a time of 3:08:41 in the pouring rain.
John Busque and Everett Hackett took 3rd and 4th in the Half marathon in 1:05:52 and 1:06:32 respectively. 
Chris Helminski and Nick Blanchard took 2nd and 3rd in the 5k coming in at 15:31 and 16:15 as well. 
Conditions during the race were described by one participant as, “cold, wet, and miserable” and the boys 
certainly dug deep on home turf. John, Everett, and Nick “Brunchard” then went on to represent Hartbeat at 
the Kent Pumpkin run with a 1-2-3 sweep. Sam Montclair came up huge in the Richmond Half marathon with a PR of 1:06:46. 
Most recently, Busque travelled all the way to Las Vegas and ran 1:05:52 in the Rock n’ Roll Half marathon. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
The team now has Manchester Road Race as its next target followed by a full schedule of indoor track meets. 
Come out and see us race!</span></p>

	      opens outdoor season at Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day 10k Road Race</span></h2>
      <hr>
      

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Hartbeat Track Club, a newly-formed group of sub-elite Hartford area runners, began its outdoor
campaign at the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day 10k Road Race on March 17I. UHart
alumnus and local physical therapist John Busque headlined the group, kicking
down former Holyoke champion Zachary Hine in a time of 30:37 with beautiful
sprinter form. 2017 CT runner of the year, Everett Hackett, running without his
keynote Vibrams, clocked in at 31:13 while outkicking former elite runner Alene
Reta. “I always knew I had it in me,” Hackett said after the race. “I just
needed my overripe bananas to get there.” After narrowly making it to the line
for race time, UChicago alumnus Tima Karginov ran a time of 32:31 good for 7<sup>th</sup>, while former
Appalachian State Mountaineer Phil Mitchell, checking in for his delayed
teammate and working back to his 30:30 days after retirement, closed out the
group in 37:48 good for 43<sup>rd</sup>.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
The venue, Holyoke, MA, produced a bustling atmosphere; a sea of green shirts overwhelmed the hilly
streets overlooking the Connecticut river as spectators – rather, partygoers –
had begun the festivities hours before the gun went off. Packed up in a tight
huddle on a chilly day, the elite group went off past a roaring and raucous
crowd of thousands hugging the rails on along the opening 800m flats. After the
first mile, the race quickly splintered as the ensuing 3-mile climb began; a
lead pack of four runners slowing down to a grueling 5:30 pace uphill and a
thin line of pursuers falling further and further back.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
As the lead group reached the peak, Busque and Hine broke away with Reta and Hackett in pursuit.
A blistering 4:20 downhill mile proved to be a crushing blow for Reta and
Hackett as Busque and Craig remained neck and neck. After several attempts by
Busque to shake Hine, the latter broke free and powered up the last 100m.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Surely at this point Busque was on the outside looking in; and yet, he must have “felt so full of
running” and that “this was the chance to do something special”. In the last
50m, Busque put on his best sprinter hands, blasting by Hine to the cheers of
“Go Zachary” for the win. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'> <span style='color:black'>
“[I] put the head down and prayed he didn’t sneak by me again before the line,” Busque said about the
effort. “[It was a] fun day; I [will] be back at this one in the future.”
Following Busque’s suit, Hackett decided to rein in Reta, all smiles as he
crossed the line.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
“It was exciting to run a race again. It has been a long time since I have competed regularly and this
was the first step to becoming competitive again. I loved having teammates to
share the experience with, and I can’t wait to race with Hartbeat again,”
Mitchell commented. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'> <span style='color:black'>
Following the effort, Hartbeat TC took to the long run the next day, leaving no time to rest on their laurels. Their next sights are set
for the 10k and 5k at the Bison Outdoor Classic on April 15.</span></p>
