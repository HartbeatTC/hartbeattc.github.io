      <hr>
      

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
This past Thursday, Everett Hackett and John Busque shipped out West for the USATF Marathon Championships 
in Sacramento, California for a shot at the Olympic Trials Qualifying B Standard of 2:19:00. Hackett entered 
the race with a 2:25:27 best from the 2015 Hartford Marathon while Busque was making a marathon debut. After 
two weeks of questioning the potentially smoky air quality in Northern California, the boys were blessed with 
great racing weather and a field of 85 elite men to run with from all over the United States.  What an opportunity
to run fast! </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
The two planned to be patient in the opening miles as experience had taught Everett a lesson
or two about the consequences of a fast start (in his 2:25:27 performance in 2015 he came through
the half marathon in 1:08:30).  At 7o’clock sharp, the two Hartbeat contenders headed southwest 
from Folsom on the point-to-point course in hopes of returning to the Sacramento finish-line before 
9:19 AM. Packs quickly formed; however, Hackett and Busque worked together as planned, sharing fluid 
bottles and joking about how proud the Hartbeat contingent would be of their 69 flat half-marathon split. 
</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
 They were feeling good and ready to roll the last half; still on pace for an OTQ at the 30 kilometers.
And yet, at the 20 mile mark, Everett began slowly falling off pace while Busque tried holding on to 
the few runners in the pack desperately attempting to maintain 5:18/mile pace. When asked after the race
how he felt, Hackett reported that “his legs were filled with cement”. “After 20 miles, not even the Nike
8%’s could have saved me from the wall”, Hackett claimed. Shortly after leaving his training partner, 
Busque too felt the ill effects of a 26.2 mile race. At 35k he was still on 2:19 pace, but was unable to 
hold on.  Busque was quoted as saying that “he would rather have consumed an entire loaf of gluten-filled 
bread then finish the last 5k of the race.” But he still finished; slowly. 
</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Busque finished in 2:20:24, slightly more than 80 seconds short of a trials qualifying 
time while Hackett came to the finish in 2:24:08, a PR by 1:17. Despite coming up short 
of their goals, they both finished much stronger runners from the experience. They will 
have many more chances to achieve their goal and are looking forward to bringing alongside 
other club members in the future to go after an OTQ.

      <hr>
      

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
When we last left our hometown heroes, the boys were gearing up for the end of road racing 
and what better way to close out the season than with the turkey trot to end all turkey trots…
The Manchester Road Race! For anyone not familiar, Manchester is a straightforward course; 
one big loop consisting of just one hill totaling 4.748 miles. This year however, 
weather was certainly not favorable for anyone seeking a PR (aside from the now course record
holder Cheserek who apparently does not experience cold) with temperatures reaching 15 degrees Fahrenheit 
and 20 mph winds at the time the gun went off. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Despite adverse conditions, Hartbeat TC toed the 
line with confidence and finished strong among a very impressive field. John Busque led the team 
finishing in 25th with a time of 23:28, followed by recent buzz-cut recipient Everett Hackett (23:42), 
resident nice guy Sam Montclair (23:47), coaching phenom Nick Aguila (24:42), and everyone’s favorite English 
teacher Chris Helminski (25:28) would round out the top 5.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
 Pizza lover Nick Blanchard then came through in 27:06, followed by Phil “I’ll offer brunch once and never mention it again” 
Mitchell (27:13), Emmett “I thought it was cold in September” Coughlin (27:32), Kevin “I only date girls with good credit scores” 
Rivera (30:08) and Jeff Billing (33:42). </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
 On behalf of Hartbeat TC, I would like to extend our thanks to the Manchester Road Race organizers and 
volunteers for putting on such a great event year after year. Next up, Busque and Hackett will travel across 
the continent to Sacramento, CA for the California International Marathon with their sights set on securing 
an Olympic Trials qualifying time.</span></p>

As the days get colder and Minski’s daylight savings rants reach an all-time high,
the team has been busy getting in the last cross country and road races of the season. 
This past October the team were shipping up to Boston for the 2018 instalment of the B.A.A. 
Mayor’s Cup held in scenic Franklin Park. After a cold and windy race, Everett Hackett posted 
an impressive 6th place finish in 24:21. Phil Mitchell also ran a very strong race finishing in 27:09 
followed by myself in 28:29. After a cool-down consisting of a few miles and a few more beers at the pub down the street, 
the squad left Beantown with a renewed drive.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
On the blacktop, Kevin Rivera made his marathon debut here at home in Hartford with a time of 3:08:41 in the pouring rain.
John Busque and Everett Hackett took 3rd and 4th in the Half marathon in 1:05:52 and 1:06:32 respectively. 
Chris Helminski and Nick Blanchard took 2nd and 3rd in the 5k coming in at 15:31 and 16:15 as well. 
Conditions during the race were described by one participant as, “cold, wet, and miserable” and the boys 
certainly dug deep on home turf. John, Everett, and Nick “Brunchard” then went on to represent Hartbeat at 
the Kent Pumpkin run with a 1-2-3 sweep. Sam Montclair came up huge in the Richmond Half marathon with a PR of 1:06:46. 
Most recently, Busque travelled all the way to Las Vegas and ran 1:05:52 in the Rock n’ Roll Half marathon. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
The team now has Manchester Road Race as its next target followed by a full schedule of indoor track meets. 
Come out and see us race!</span></p>

      <h2 id="Holyoke2018"><span style='color:black'> Busque digs deep to win, Hackett 3rd as Hartbeat Track Club
	      opens outdoor season at Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day 10k Road Race</span></h2>
      <hr>
      

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Hartbeat Track Club, a newly-formed group of sub-elite Hartford area runners, began its outdoor
campaign at the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day 10k Road Race on March 17I. UHart
alumnus and local physical therapist John Busque headlined the group, kicking
down former Holyoke champion Zachary Hine in a time of 30:37 with beautiful
sprinter form. 2017 CT runner of the year, Everett Hackett, running without his
keynote Vibrams, clocked in at 31:13 while outkicking former elite runner Alene
Reta. “I always knew I had it in me,” Hackett said after the race. “I just
needed my overripe bananas to get there.” After narrowly making it to the line
for race time, UChicago alumnus Tima Karginov ran a time of 32:31 good for 7<sup>th</sup>, while former
Appalachian State Mountaineer Phil Mitchell, checking in for his delayed
teammate and working back to his 30:30 days after retirement, closed out the
group in 37:48 good for 43<sup>rd</sup>.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
The venue, Holyoke, MA, produced a bustling atmosphere; a sea of green shirts overwhelmed the hilly
streets overlooking the Connecticut river as spectators – rather, partygoers –
had begun the festivities hours before the gun went off. Packed up in a tight
huddle on a chilly day, the elite group went off past a roaring and raucous
crowd of thousands hugging the rails on along the opening 800m flats. After the
first mile, the race quickly splintered as the ensuing 3-mile climb began; a
lead pack of four runners slowing down to a grueling 5:30 pace uphill and a
thin line of pursuers falling further and further back.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
As the lead group reached the peak, Busque and Hine broke away with Reta and Hackett in pursuit.
A blistering 4:20 downhill mile proved to be a crushing blow for Reta and
Hackett as Busque and Craig remained neck and neck. After several attempts by
Busque to shake Hine, the latter broke free and powered up the last 100m.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
Surely at this point Busque was on the outside looking in; and yet, he must have “felt so full of
running” and that “this was the chance to do something special”. In the last
50m, Busque put on his best sprinter hands, blasting by Hine to the cheers of
“Go Zachary” for the win. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'> <span style='color:black'>
“[I] put the head down and prayed he didn’t sneak by me again before the line,” Busque said about the
effort. “[It was a] fun day; I [will] be back at this one in the future.”
Following Busque’s suit, Hackett decided to rein in Reta, all smiles as he
crossed the line.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>
“It was exciting to run a race again. It has been a long time since I have competed regularly and this
was the first step to becoming competitive again. I loved having teammates to
share the experience with, and I can’t wait to race with Hartbeat again,”
Mitchell commented. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'> <span style='color:black'>
Following the effort, Hartbeat TC took to the long run the next day, leaving no time to rest on their laurels. Their next sights are set
for the 10k and 5k at the Bison Outdoor Classic on April 15.</span></p>
